  <span class="site-name">Trump Twitter Archive - @realtrumptweet</span>
</div>

<p>The Trump Twitter Archive contains almost every tweet from @realdonaldtrump since he joined in 2009 and will remain current (within a day or two) until <span class="strikethrough">election day</span> the end of his presidency. If any tweets are retroactively deleted, they will remain in the archive.</p>

<p>The goal of this site is to make it easy for anyone to instantly search through all of Trump's 30,000+ tweets. Type in any keyword and you'll immediately see every tweet that contains that word or phrase: <i>Obama</i>, <i>the worst</i>, <i>Mexico</i>, <i>rosie</i>, etc. There are a variety of filters to make the search more precise. If you find anything interesting, hit the <i>link to this search</i> button and share the results with your friends and political nemeses.</p>

<p>I ended up reading (almost) every tweet, and grouped various quotes and tweets together on the highlights page. I'll let readers draw their own conclusions. </p>

<p>If you're interested in getting around Twitter's 3200 tweet retrieval limit, see the process <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/howto/all_tweets.html" target="_blank">here</a>. There is also a slightly more thorough, yet more technical way detailed <a href="https://github.com/bpb27/twitter_scraping" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the raw data, it's freely <a href="https://github.com/bpb27/political_twitter_archive" target="_blank">available</a> in both JSON format and CSV format. If you're using it for a project or something cool, let me know.</p>

<p>And if that feeling of numbness after the election ever abates and you feel an upswell of charity, perhaps consider supporting the site via the button below. It's hugely appreciated. Thanks for visiting. </p>

<h3 class="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><u>Do you save deleted tweets? Why can't I find the "unpresidented" tweet in your archive?</u></p>
<p>I collect the latest tweets a few times a day. It is not yet a real-time monitoring system. For the "unpresidented" tweet, he deleted it 30 minutes after tweeeting it. In that 30 minute window, I did not do any tweet collection, so I missed it. If I do collect a tweet, however, I have it archived forever, even if he deletes it later. Fortunately, there is a site called <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank">Politiwoops</a> that does store his quickly deleted tweets.</p>

<p><u>Can I use your data?</u></p>
<p>Yes! It's <a href="https://github.com/bpb27/political_twitter_archive" target="_blank">here</a>. And let me know if you create anything cool.</p>

<p><u>What's the deal with the timestamps? Are you sure they're accurate?</u></p>
<p>I collect metadata on each tweet via Tweepy and Twitter's official API, which returns a "created_at" date in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). All the raw data is stored with a GMT timestamp, and the website translates that to Eastern Standard Time, which is 5 hours behind. Unfortunately, not all his tweets come with location data, so I'm unable to further translate a tweet 3 more hours behind if he tweeted from California (PST). It's an imperfect system, but likely the most accurate.</p>

<p><u>But when I look at a tweet timestamp on Twitter.com, it seems like it doesn't match with your site!</u></p>
<p>That might be true. Twitter displays tweet times to me in PST even though I live on the east coast. So it's not a particularly accurate gauge, since it also attempts to do some time zone adjustment itself.</p>

<h3 class="center">Updates:</h3>

<p>Update 1/4 (New Years update): The archive is expanding to include a range of political figures associated with the Trump administration. If you have any accounts you'd like to see on here, please email me.</p>

<p>Update 11/21: Uncovered 3000+ additional tweets using a process I detail <a href="https://github.com/bpb27/twitter_scraping">here</a>. The insult counters have been increased.</p>

<p>Update 10/2: Two new updates: timestamps and device of origin. Timestamps are in Eastern Standard Time (translated -0500 from GMT). Device of origin shows what mobile or web device / platform Trump used to send the tweet.</p>

<p>Update 9/23: Almost 9000 more tweets have been found that did not originally appear via Twitter's search function. They have been added to the archive, and the totals and lists on the highlights page have been updated. Suspiciously, almost all the tweets with profanity did not appear in the original search. Fortunately, they're now available <a ng-href="/#/highlights/profanity">here</a>. Huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/IgorBrigadir" target="_blank">@IgorBrigadir</a> for uncovering this and helping out. </p>
